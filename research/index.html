	<h1>Research</h1>
	
	<p>My MA and PhD research focused on syntax, the abstract structure of language.
		My postdoctoral research focuses on how the brain uses syntax to translate from thought to language.
		Below are brief descriptions of the major projects I have spearheaded.</p>
	
	<h2>Artificial Language Learning shows that language learners can acquire structures not in their input</h2>
	
	<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/20445911.2021.1928678" target="_blank">Morgan and Ferreira (2021)</a>, <a href="https://lpl.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Vic Ferreira</a> and I test a surprising prediction of one of the central tenets of mainstream linguistic theory: that, under certain circumstances, language learners should be able to learn particular syntactic structures without ever having been exposed to them.
		We designed a series of artificial languages with the properties thought to facilitate this type of exposure-free acquisition, taught these languages to participants, and then tested their ability to use the target structure -- the one they had never seen or heard before.
		In four experiments, learners spontaneously produced the unexposed structure, providing the first experimental evidence we are aware of that supports a controversial theory.

	<h2>The relationship between language comprehension and production</h2>
	
	<p>Two projects investigated a syntactic structure called resumption, e.g., the use of “he” in “That’s the criminal who nobody knew how he escaped.”  
		Resumption is paradoxical in that it is ungrammatical but nonetheless frequently used by speakers.  
		This is problematic for extant psycholinguistic models, which cannot account for the systematic and intentional production of ungrammatical sentences.  
		Some researchers have proposed that speakers in fact have two sets of syntactic rules: one for comprehension and one for production. 
		However, this leads to its own complications, such as the possibility that people could speak a language they do not understand.  
		In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00293" target="_blank">Morgan and Wagers (2018)</a>, <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers/" target="_blank">Matt Wagers</a> and I used a sentence completion paradigm to show that speakers produce this structure only when language processing is exceptionally difficult. 
		We proposed a model which explains resumption as the result of a breakdown in production processes due to, e.g., memory overload. 
		This model obviates the need for distinct syntactic representations for comprehension and production.  
		Later, in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104417" target="_blank">Morgan et al. (2020)</a>, <a href="https://tmalsburg.github.io/" target="_blank">Titus von der Malsburg</a>, <a href="https://lpl.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Vic Ferreira</a>, <a href="https://lcl.ucsd.edu/people/" target="_blank">Eva Wittenberg</a>, and I used a variety of behavioral paradigms to demonstrate that comprehension processes are consistent with our 2018 production model.</p>

	<h2>Individual differences as a tool for syntactic model building </h2>
	
	<p>In <a href="that-trace9.pdf" target="_blank">Morgan (in press)</a>, I used a psychometric paradigm to test one of the central assumptions in theoretical linguistics.
		This assumption had previously relied solely on theoretical arguments. Specifically, while the word “that” is typically optional (“I think (that) she cried.”), most speakers find it ungrammatical in certain contexts: “It was the host who I think (that) cried.”  
		This phenomenon, the so-called “That-Trace Effect” (TTE), might be uninteresting if not for the fact that it occurs in a surprisingly large number of the world’s ~6000 languages. 
		Many linguists therefore believe that it reflects a biological constraint on human language processing. 
		Incidentally, all of these facts are also true of another ungrammatical structure: the “Island Boundary-Gap Effect” (IBGE), as in, “It was the host who I wondered why (she) cried.”  
		Since the 1970s, mainstream linguistic theory has assumed the TTE and IBGE derive from the same underlying constraint.
		However, the two have different structures, and there is no evidence beyond superficial similarities that the two are related.
		A major obstacle to demonstrating their equivalence has been related to limitations of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing.
		By adopting a psychometric paradigm to measure individual differences, I was able to reframe the statistical question and show positive evidence supporting the idea that the two effects are in fact the same.</p>

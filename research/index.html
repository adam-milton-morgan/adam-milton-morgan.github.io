	<h1>Research</h1>
	
	<p>My MA and PhD research focused on syntax, the abstract structure of language.
		My postdoctoral research focuses on how the brain uses syntax to translate from thought to language.
		Below are brief descriptions of the major projects I have spearheaded.</p>

	<h2>The relationship between language comprehension and production</h2>
	
	<p>Two of my major projects investigated a syntactic structure called resumption, e.g., the use of “he” in “That’s the criminal who nobody knew how he escaped.”  
		Resumption is paradoxical in that it is ungrammatical but nonetheless frequently used by speakers.  
		This is problematic for extant psycholinguistic models, which cannot account for the systematic and intentional production of ungrammatical sentences.  
		Some researchers have proposed that speakers in fact have two sets of syntactic rules: one for comprehension and one for production. 
		However, this leads to its own complications, such as the possibility that people could speak a language they do not understand.  
		Morgan and Wagers (2018) used a sentence completion paradigm to show that speakers produce this structure only when language processing is exceptionally difficult. 
		We proposed a model which explains resumption as the result of a breakdown in production processes due to, e.g., memory overload. 
		This model obviates the need for distinct syntactic representations for comprehension and production.  
		Later, Morgan et al. (2020) used a variety of behavioral paradigms to demonstrate that comprehension processes are consistent with our 2018 production model.</p>

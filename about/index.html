	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I'm a postdoctoral fellow in Adeen Flinker's lab at the NYU School of Medicine, Department of Neurology.</p>
	<p>My research broadly focuses on how the brain translates from thought to language using tools like ECoG and syntactic priming.</p>
	<p>The site is (obviously) a work in progress.</p>

	<h1>Adam M. Morgan</h1>
	<p>I'm a postdoctoral fellow in Adeen Flinker's lab in the Neurology Department at the NYU School of Medicine.</p>
	
	<p>My research aims to understand how the brain translates from thought to language using tools like ECoG and syntactic priming.
		ECoG (electrocorticography) involves measuring electrical activity on the surface of the brain in awake neurosurgical patients.
		It has unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution, allowing us to know precisely where and when a signal originates, unlike non-invasive methods like fMRI, EEG, and MEG.</p>
